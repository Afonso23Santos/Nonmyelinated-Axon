# Nonmyelinated-Axon
Modelling a nonmyelinated axon response to an applied electric field 


In 1952, Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) published a series of five scientific papers in which they detail ion movement in neurons, during the action potential. The quantitative movel produced by their empirical measurements enables the simulation of action potential propagation in neurons. The work present in this repository uses the HH model to model a nonmyelinated axon response to an applied electric field, and then to simulate the action potential propagation.

Codes for the modelled response:
Parte1HH.m -> function
Parteum.m -> script with quiz answers

Codes for the simulation:
Parte2HH.m -> function
partedois.m -> script with quiz answers
parametros.m -> script with constans, matrices and function parameters

Run "parteum.m" and "partedois.m" to obtain results.
